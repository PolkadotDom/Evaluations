## Argument

### 'Hard Pressure' Issuance Model

With the passing of [Ref 1710 - Hard Pressure Capped & Stepped Supply Schedule](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1710), I worked with the community to quickly get an implementation together in [#898](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/898). This new code represents a significant departure from our previous macro economic policy and required the implementation of new curve types-- My hope is these new curves will be a benefit to the entire ecosystem. The general purpose curves can be found [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9556).

### RFC 150 - Voting While Delegating

I have continued to refine [RFC-150](https://github.com/PolkadotDom/RFCs/blob/dom/voting-while-delegating/text/0150-voting-while-delegating.md) at the request of fellow members.
